## Training and test agent in lunar lander environment with DQN stable baselines algorithm

1. Stable baselines module was installed using anaconda to support Tensorflow 1.8. 
2. DQN agent was trained using DQN stable baselines algorithm with learning_rate = 0.003 and time_steps = 500000
3. After learning stage, agent was tested loading l_lander_dqn.zip file. Below is a gif with recording result
